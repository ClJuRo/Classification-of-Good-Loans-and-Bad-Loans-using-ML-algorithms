Predictive Modeling of Credit Risk Faced by a P2P lending platform

# Description
The Irish bank is a P2P lending platform, which provides funds to potential borrowers and earns a profit on the interest, which depends on the risk they take (the borrowers credit score). The platform provides loan to its loyal customers. The platform wants to understand whether the loan they have provided to their customers will be recovered or not. 
Leveraging a dataset inspired by Lending Club but modified for educational purposes, this study aims to analyze the credit risk associated with loans provided by the bank and predict which loan shall go bad.

# Motivation Behind the study
The study aims at solving problem for the bank where it can provide loans to its customers safely i.e. with minimum chances of default. The problem can be solved by creating predictive models using Machine learning models which depend on inputs provided by the customer during the KYC. This will help the platform to differentiate between a good customer.
